# simple_shell
simple shell is our second project in the ALX SE fondations.
In this project we are requered to build our own simple shell,the project is devided in two part the madatory tasks :
1. UNIX command line interpreter.
2. okenize .
3. Handle PATH.
4. built-in command exit.
5. built-in command env.

Advanced tasks:

6. our personal getline function .
7. our personal strtok function .
8. built-in command exit with argument.
9. built-in commands setenv and unsetenv.
10. builtin command cd.
11. handle separator ;.
12. Handle logical operators the && and ||.
13. built-in command Alias.
14. Handle variables replacement $? and $$.
15. Handle comments (#)
16. File as input.

now lets us explain to you dear reader how we get into this challenging project, 

this project has includes everything we have learn so far in our ALX formation, it was a good practice for us to have a more understanding of all the concepts we have studied befor,
befor starting we need to know what is shell and how it works, so we could know where to start from 
for our first task we had to :
Read command from the stdin using the getline function
the display the prompt with en endless loop 
split commands (tokenizing) with strtok.
search for executable commands PATH.
create child process (fork)
executing the command (exec)
wait for command => the parent shell wait for the child to complete (waitpid)
display output
return the prompt
exit the shell (exit) or (ctr + D)

this was our frame work we build an enviroment that could accept any additional features that we gonna add after basing on the tasks .

this project was quite a ride!
overall this project was a good experience for both of us as a team, we learned so mush from it, we get to understand shell deeply , it was really challenging but it was a good learning experience .
